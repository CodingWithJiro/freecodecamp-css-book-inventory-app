## ℹ️ A Simple Landing Page for a Book Inventory App

![Screenshot of the project](./screenshot.png)

This responsive project displays a book inventory in a clean table layout using only HTML and CSS.

It was built entirely with HTML and CSS as part of the [**freeCodeCamp.org**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/) CSS course.

## 🔍 Overview

This project demonstrates how to present data clearly in a tabular format using semantic HTML elements and creative CSS design. Each row of the table represents a book, including its title, author, category, status, and a visual rating bubble using gradients.

The table is color-coded by reading status — _Read_, _In Progress_, and _To Read_ — to enhance readability which also features accessibility.
